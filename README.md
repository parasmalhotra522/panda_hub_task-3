# Axios TypeScript API Task

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a network/API call using **Axios** with **TypeScript**. It follows a clean and extensible structure to fetch data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) and serves as a solution for Task 3 â€“ Backend Logic. The code is designed to be reusable and understandable by other developers.

- **Objective:** Assess the use of Axios for data fetching, TypeScript for type safety, and a clean async logic structure.

## Features
- Fetches a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Implements TypeScript interfaces for request/response data.
